# CHM-T36VA-Control-Module
This is the control module to the CHM-T36VA pick and place machine. 

This is a work in progress. If anyone is able to contribute to this design please fork this repo! Hopefully this will give the OpenPNP community an opportunity to integrate into the CHM-T36VA. Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions!
